## üìÑ Project Overview

**Title:** Dynamic Pricing for Urban Parking Lots

**Goal:** To build a smart pricing engine that dynamically updates parking prices in urban areas based on real-time demand signals such as occupancy, queue length, traffic level, vehicle type, time, and location.

## üìã Problem Statement

Urban parking faces imbalances in demand and pricing. Fixed pricing models result in either overutilized or underutilized lots. This project addresses this by building a real-time pricing model that adapts dynamically to changing demand factors.


## üéØ Objectives

Your goal is to build a dynamic pricing model for each parking space such that:
‚Ä¢ The price is realistically updated in real-time based on:
‚Äì Historical occupancy patterns
‚Äì Queue length
‚Äì Nearby traffic
‚Äì Special events
‚Äì Vehicle type
‚Äì Competitor parking prices
‚Ä¢ It starts from a base price of $10
‚Ä¢ The price variation is smooth and explainable, not erratic

## üìä [Dataset](https://github.com/devisaibheemanadi-2003/Dynamic-Pricing-For-Urban-Parking-Lots/blob/main/dataset.csv)

The dataset contains 18,368 records from 14 urban parking spaces over 73 days with:
- **Location**: Latitude, Longitude
- **Capacity**: Maximum vehicles
- **Occupancy**: Current vehicles parked
- **Queue Length**: Vehicles waiting
- **Vehicle Type**: Car, bike, truck, cycle
- **Traffic Conditions**: Low, average, high
- **Special Days**: Holidays/events indicator
- **Timestamps**: Date and time information

## üß† Models Implemented
### Model 1: Baseline Linear Pricing
```python
Price = Previous_Price + Œ± √ó (Occupancy / Capacity)
```
- Simple linear relationship with occupancy rate
- Acts as baseline for comparison
- Parameters: Œ± (learning rate), min/max price bounds

### Model 2: Demand-Based Pricing Function
```python
Demand = Œ±√óOccupancy_Rate + Œ≤√óQueue + Œ≥√óTraffic + Œ¥√óSpecial_Day + Œµ√óVehicle_Weight
Price = Base_Price √ó (1 + Œª√óNormalized_Demand) √ó Vehicle_Weight
```
- Multi-factor demand calculation
- Vehicle-specific pricing weights
- Traffic condition multipliers
- Special day premiums
- Bounded using tanh normalization
